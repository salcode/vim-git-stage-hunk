INTRODUCTION                     *git-stage-hunk-introduction* *git-stage-hunk*

When manually staging a Git hunk, the changes are more likely to successfully
apply when the range information of the Unified Diff Format
(e.g. @@ -1,3 +1,9 @@) is modified.

This plugin adds a command (|:GitHunkToggle|) and a normal mode mapping
(|git-stage-hunk-mapping|) to make these modifications easier.

COMMANDS *git-stage-hunk-commands*

The :GitHunkToggle command behaves differently depending on the type of line
as determined by the first character on the line

- (minus) this line is marked for deletion, the command removes the deletion
  (i.e. replaces the - with a space.

+ (plus) this line is marked as an addition, the command eliminates the line
  from the hunk by removing the line entirely

  (space) this line is part of the diff for reference, the command will mark
  the line for deletion by converting the first character (space) to a minus -

MAPPING *git-stage-hunk-mapping*

By default the :GitHunkToggle command is mapped to <space><space>

Custom Mapping~
                                                *git-stage-hunk-custom-mapping*

We can override the default mapping with a line like the following in our
|vimrc|. This will map ,h to the :GitHunkToggle command in normal mode.

nnoremap ,h :GitHunkToggle<CR>

When a custom mapping like this is assigned, the default mapping is NOT set.
